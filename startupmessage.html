</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>CR = Connected Realms - EG You can trade/join guild ETC. Jamba will function as though your team is on the same realm!</p>
<p>CR = CrossRealm - Join a realm over CRZ tech. Note: Some modules in Jamba will not function or will not work correctly while in CRZ. This is due to limitations in Blizzard's API. You can talk over realms with addons, however YOU NEED TO BE IN PARTY WITH THE MEMBER FOR ANYTHING TO WORK!</p>
<h2>Automated Offline System Added:</h2>
