<p>* Character names now must be in name-server format, .e.g. Ebony-Outland</p><br/>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>CR = Connected Realms - EG You can trade/join guild ETC. Jamba will function as though your team is on the same realm!</p>
<p>CR = CrossRealm - Join a realm over CRZ tech. Note: Some modules in Jamba will not function or will not work correctly while in CRZ. This is due to limitations in Blizzard's API. You can talk over realms with addons, however YOU NEED TO BE IN PARTY WITH THE MEMBER FOR ANYTHING TO WORK!</p>
<br/>
<h2>Automated Offline System Added:</h2>
<br/>
<p>* Jamba will now automatically set minions offline if the minion is not online. Jamba will dectect when the minion comes online and sets the status to online. You can now have a full list of characters and not have to worry about online/offline. Easy switching!</p>

<br/>
<p>* Remember to do the following fixes on every character in your team!</p>
*
If your team list is full of empty lines, please reset the current profile. Warning this will require you to configure everything again. You can
reset the current profile with the following button: /jamba > Profiles > Core: Profiles > Reset Profile
<p>* Make sure to add characters into your team list with their name, followed by a dash and the server the character is on. e.g. Ebony-servername</p>
<br/>
<h2>ISBoxer Users</h2>
<br/>
<p>* Please make sure your ISBoxer version is ISBoxer 41.10.1115.1 or higher.</p>
