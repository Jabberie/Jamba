Notes:

CR = connected realms EG You can trade/join guild ETC. All of jamba will work like normal Like your playing the same realm!

CR = Join a Realm Over CRZ tech Note some of jamba will not work this is not down to me this is how blizzard Lets you talk over realms with addons YOU NEED TO BE IN PARTY WITH THE MEMBER FOR ANYTHING TO WORK! And some stuff might not work as you wish

-----TODO-------
*Jamba-Quest
-Removed the Jamba-Team quest bar (whatever you want to call it).[*]When you use the blizzard Quest UI to drop quests it will now auto Drop them on the Clones.[*]When you use the blizzzard Quest UI to Track Quests It will not auto Track on clones[*]Holding a Alt Key will stop them going to clones i think its a cleaner System.
 Not had time to work on this will be done next.
