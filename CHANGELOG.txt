No longer should add -realmname when adding team names to the team list. This is going to help with ISBoxerboxer addon that adds character-realmname

Added a button to add party members to the team under on the GUI team display so you don't have to use the the command line. ( I did not even know this was there.)

Known Issues

Item-Bar

Mounts and pets are temporarily no longer welcome on the item use bar. Blizzard has made changes to the way the mounts API works.
The current workarounds are rather complicated. [1]
I've taken the opportunity tidy up internally and this means pets are also missing out until I can concoct a solution.

[1] http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49599

Quest and Quest Watcher

The functions on the quest log bar (abandon all, share all, etc) may no longer work properly.
Quests in the Quest Watcher will not automatically remove themselves when done. As a workaround, you can click the Update button on all characters to
get a fresh list.
Because of the WoW changes to the quest log, I'm going to spend some time trying a few things to see if I can come up with an updated solution to some of the quest functionality.

Fixes

DisplayTeam
* Character portraits in team list should now stay zoomed in on the head rather than reverting to full body shots.
* If show reputation bar is on and a character has no faction selected the reputation bar will show "No Faction Selected" rather than crashing with a Lua error.

Item-Use
* Add a Clear Item Bar button at the bottom of the Item Use options to clear the item bar for a character.

Purchase
* A message will be sent if the character doing the purchasing has full bags.

Toon: Currency

General Bug Fixes for WoW 6.0
* Modules that use frames should find they can now be moved again.
* Modules that used the API function InCombatLockdown should work correctly now.
* Lots of changes to internal WoW API functions that used to return 1/nil to now check for true/false states instead.

* Added two pass loot system from Tehtsuo back into AdvancedLoot so that lootable corpses will still sparkle for all toons if an item of interest is available to be looted.

This change means that when Assume All Team Members Online is checked, there will be no chat channel spam when the ElvUI addon is loaded as well as Jamba.

Display-Team
	* Clique / ClickToCast can now be used with the health and power bars!
	* You can now choose to display the team list horizontally.

Item Use
	* All items have been removed from the bar.  You will need to add them back in.
	* Item Bar will now take mounts, non-combat pets, spells and maybe other things if you are lucky.  Items still work.
	* Item Bar items now have tooltips and cooldowns and flashes and the kitchen sink and other nifty features and I need cookies!
	* New option, if checked, will automatically add usable quest items and items that start a quest to the item bar.
	* Maximum amount of items increased to 20.
	* New row slider lets you choose how many rows of items to display your items in.

Sell
	* New option to auto-sell lower-tiered unusable soulbound armor types.  For instance, if set, a paladin would sell all soulbound mail, leather and cloth armour types (not weapons, not rings, not necklaces and not trinkets).  If you turn this option, be careful with cloaks (equip them if you want to keep them when you get them).

Trade
	* New option to adjust money with master on trade.  If this option is turned on, anytime a slave toon trades with a master toon, the slave toon will automatically load any excess money over the amount specified into the trade window ready for trading.

Team
	* New option - activate click-to-move on slaves and deactivate on master when switching master.

Quest
	* If choose best reward option selected and the claim sub-option is off, when a toon completes a quest, the others in the party will complete it as well, rather than you having to click complete quest on each toon.

Quest Watcher
	* The quest watcher will no longer assume that all quests have been completed when a certain combination of settings is selected.  Thanks to ElectronDF for being persistent about this bug!

Proc
	* The 4.2.0 patch changed the combat log unflitered event which broke procs notification. Fixed.
	* When procs are used, they should be removed from the screen properly.  Please tell me if this is not the case.
	* Added the following procs: Killing Machine, Fulmination!, Sword and Board, Taste for Blood, Power Torrent.  If you already have these procs, you will need to remove the duplicates.

Core: Settings

    * Settings are no longer tied to the Blizzard Addon area and are now in their own window. The window can be shifted around, and is a lot larger than the previous area.
